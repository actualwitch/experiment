# Tool use debugging

Although Experiment doesn't execute tools directly at this time, it provides comprehensive debugging capabilities to visualize and manage tool schemas within your chat interactions. Add tools by pasting a JSON schema into chat and creating a message with it by pressing (Enter) and you will see it visualized in a convenient form with all props sorted first by name, then by depth. Click on the name of the prop to collapse it. You can append multiple tools to chat and they will be available to the model. Tool use completions are also visualized in a similar manner. By default UI uses `markdown` renderer mode, but in some cases switching to `Text + JSON` can be helpful, as in this mode inline JSON is rendered by the same component as tools.
