# Principles

1. **Less is more.** Going just 20% of the path is fine if it gets the job done.
2. **Agile and lean.** Optimize for flexibility and reduce waste.
3. **Isomorphic.** Run exact same code wherever possible.
4. **No flicker.** System fonts and server side rendering for instant loading.
5. **Bleeding edge.** To prevent stale dependency hell, dev mode always upgrades dependencies to the latest version.
