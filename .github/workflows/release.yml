            > If you are using macOS or Linux, you need to give the downloaded file permission to execute:
            > ```shellscript
            > chmod +x ./experiment-*
            > ```
            > For macOS users specifically, removing quarantine is also necessary:
            > ```shellscript
            > xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./experiment-*
